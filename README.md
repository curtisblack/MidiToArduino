# MidiToArduino

This program reads a midi file and outputs Arduino sketches to play the song on buzzers.
It ouputs multiple sketches as it assumes each Arduino has one buzzer attached.
Each Arduino should have their D2 pins connected together.
The song can be started on all Arduinos simultaneously by bringing D2 LOW.
